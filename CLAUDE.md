# CLAUDE.md — the `kerby` repo

`kerby` is the gate guardian for agentic coding: a loadable rule-corpus + opt-in
guardrail hooks that govern how an agent does coding work (clarity over cleverness,
safety over speed, never leave the repo broken — and *nothing unproven passes the
gate*). The skill itself lives at [`skills/kerby/`](skills/kerby/SKILL.md); the rules
it loads live in [`skills/kerby/rulebooks/swe/BOOTSTRAP.md`](skills/kerby/rulebooks/swe/BOOTSTRAP.md).

This file is the repo-root context doc. Its main job is to hold the **harness-engineering
vocabulary** that `SKILL.md` references — the named primitives behind how `kerby` is
built. `kerby` is the canonical, working implementation of these primitives; when the
vocabulary below cites one abstractly, the concrete machinery is somewhere under
`skills/kerby/resources/`.

## Harness vocabulary

Building a rule-corpus like `kerby` is **harness engineering** — designing everything
*around* an agent that determines whether it succeeds: context, scaffolding, feedback,
state, evaluation. Naming the primitives lets edits be deliberate instead of accidental.

| Primitive | What it means | Concrete artifact in `kerby` |
|---|---|---|
| **Context engineering** | Organize information so the agent can reason over it — repo-local, versioned, not in chat threads. | `CONTEXT.md` (project glossary) + `BOOTSTRAP.md` (operating rules) + vendor agent-context files kept in sync — see `skills/kerby/resources/references/multi-tool.md`. |
| **Progressive disclosure** | Load detail on demand instead of front-loading everything. | `BOOTSTRAP.md` is the index; `rulebooks/swe/references/*.md` carry the long-tail, loaded only when cited. |
| **Observable feedback loops** | Prefer machine-checkable signal over aspirational prose. | `rulebooks/base/hooks/pre-commit-check.sh`, `protect-env.sh`, `warn-env-read.sh`, `protect-git.sh` + gates in `references/quality-gates.md` and `references/validation.md`. |
| **State preservation** | Carry useful context across session boundaries. | `.kerby/memory.log` (append-only history) + `.kerby/STATUS.md` (current state) + `.kerby/knowledge/` (curated wiki) + `.kerby/BLOCKERS.md`, bootstrapped by `session-start-context.sh` + `knowledge-bootstrap.sh`. |
| **Eval discipline** | Decide what "working" means before shipping. | `references/quality-gates.md` + the verification-before-completion pattern; the pre-commit hook enforces gates mechanically rather than relying on agent memory. |

**How to use this vocabulary.** When you propose a new rule, ask: *which primitive is
this serving?* If you can't answer, the change is probably speculative. When you debug a
rule that "just isn't working," ask: *is the environment underspecified (context,
scaffolding, feedback) or is the prompt wrong?* Most agent failures are environment
failures wearing a prompt-failure mask.

### Control loop (loop engineering)

Prompt engineering optimizes a single forward pass. **Loop engineering** optimizes the
trajectory across many passes: the agent acts, observes a result (test output, build
error, screenshot), and that observation re-enters context and shapes the next action.
It is the runtime-control-flow half of harness engineering. `kerby` implements the loop
primitives; this table is the map — each row points to where the primitive is enforced.

| Primitive | One-line meaning | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Inner / outer check split | cheap check while coding, full gate at the boundary | `rulebooks/swe/workflows/feature.md` (iteration-check tiers vs commit check) |
| Termination condition | what must be true to exit the loop | `rulebooks/swe/references/validation.md` (Iron Law: no claim without fresh evidence) |
| Retry budget / circuit breaker | bounded retries per failure type, then escalate | `rulebooks/swe/references/error-handling.md` (build 5 / test 3 / lint 5 → BLOCKED) |
| Bounded search | cap the hypothesis count so the loop can't flail | `rulebooks/swe/references/debugging.md` (max 3 hypotheses) |
| State across iterations | what carries forward so the loop has no amnesia | `.kerby/memory.log`, `.kerby/STATUS.md`, checkpoint-before-context-fills |
| Iteration cost is the speed limit | a faster loop buys more hypotheses | `rulebooks/swe/references/debugging.md` (assess the feedback loop first) |
| Parallel loops (fan-out) | independent iterations run concurrently | `rulebooks/swe/references/sub-agent-delegation.md` (vertical slices, blind lenses) |

These are the runtime expression of the harness primitives above: *State across
iterations* is *State preservation* applied mid-task; the two check rows are *Observable
feedback loops* applied per-iteration. The rest (termination, retry budget, bounded
search, fan-out) are loop-specific.

**Bounded by design.** kerby's termination condition is deliberately *bounded*: the
loop exits on fresh verification evidence (the Iron Law) **or** on an exhausted
retry budget that escalates to a human (`BLOCKED`). It does **not** iterate
unboundedly toward "perfect." That bound is a choice, not an omission — *never leave
the repo broken* outranks autonomous self-correction, so a stuck loop hands off
rather than flails. This is the intended departure from naive "verify-until-done"
framings: a self-verification loop with no circuit breaker burns its budget
re-deriving the same wrong fix. The verification gate also leans behavioral by
design — the methodology travels across toolchains where a hardcoded check would not
(`skills/kerby/CLAUDE.md` § Authoring style). The one mechanical floor under it is
`rulebooks/base/hooks/pre-commit-check.sh`: a pure, non-disablable secret scan. Riding
alongside it (only when `swe` is selected) is `rulebooks/swe/hooks/hollow-test-check.sh`,
a soft heuristic that statically flags the green-but-empty fakes
(`rulebooks/swe/references/validation.md` § What Counts as Evidence).

## Editing the rules

The skill-internal authoring guide lives at
[`skills/kerby/CLAUDE.md`](skills/kerby/CLAUDE.md) — read it before changing rule text
(every rule carries a recurring input-token cost; each should trace to a real past
failure). Run `python3 scripts/check-skill-compat.py` after any frontmatter or
version-bearing change, and `bash skills/kerby/rulebooks/swe/scripts/check-plan-gate-parity.sh` after any
change to the plan_threshold default or the grade-≥7 approval point (it fails if
those constants drift across the files that restate them — BOOTSTRAP, the
workflows, working-patterns, the schema, the template; the checked set is listed
in the script). If you add a new restatement, add the file to that set.

Engine edits (`skills/kerby/SKILL.md`, `resources/`, repo-root `scripts/`) are
additionally bound by the **engine-independence zoning rule** in
[`docs/rulebook-contract.md`](docs/rulebook-contract.md) § Engine independence:
builtin rulebook names appear in engine surfaces only as worked examples or
bundle contents, never as something behavior keys on.

The product voice — how kerby *talks* in the README, verdict output, and CHANGELOG — is
specified in [`VOICE.md`](VOICE.md). Read it before editing any persona-bearing copy; the
rules and command references stay literal regardless (see its Zoning table).

## PR Workflow

Defined here in full — the gate must never depend on unversioned, user-local config
(a maintainer's personal `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` may mirror this as a cross-repo default,
but this section is authoritative for kerby).

**Default path — local Codex available:**
1. Branch, commit.
2. Run a local Codex review against the branch diff
   (`/codex:review --base main --scope branch`); loop review → fix → re-review until it
   returns clean. The final review must run against the exact tree you push.
   (`/codex:review` is user-only (`disable-model-invocation`) — an agent substitutes
   `/codex:rescue` with a review brief. On the maintainer's machine, a global PreToolUse
   gate additionally blocks `gh pr create` until the clean review is recorded:
   `git rev-parse HEAD > "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/codex-reviewed"` — write it only
   after a clean review of that exact tree. The gate is machine-local convenience, not
   part of this repo's gate.)
3. Open the PR noting `Codex-reviewed locally at <sha>` (the reviewed branch HEAD), then
   `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`. The local-clean review **authorizes the merge**
   — it *is* the independent-model Codex review the rule-text gate in
   `skills/kerby/CLAUDE.md` requires (Codex ≠ the authoring agent; venue doesn't matter,
   so a second GitHub pass would only re-review identical bytes).

**Fallback — no local Codex:** open the PR, trigger a GitHub `@codex review`, and poll.
**Address every comment before merging** — fix it (a fix is a new push → new review
cycle) or push back with reasoning; never merge with an open, unaddressed comment. Merge
only on a green light **against the current head**: an approval / 👍 reaction dated after
the latest push, or a reasonable silence window once ≥1 completed review of HEAD exists —
never when Codex never reviewed HEAD at all. (Poll cadence is maintainer-personal tuning,
not part of this gate.)

**Merge conventions:** squash is the default — one commit per PR on `main`; don't use
`--merge` / `--rebase` without being asked. Always pass `--delete-branch` (this repo's
`deleteBranchOnMerge` is off). Merging via this workflow **overrides kerby's own "leave
for human review" guardrail** for this repo — the owner has opted in.
