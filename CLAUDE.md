# CLAUDE.md — the `kerby` repo

`kerby` is the gate guardian for agentic coding: a loadable rule-corpus + opt-in
guardrail hooks that govern how an agent does coding work (clarity over cleverness,
safety over speed, never leave the repo broken — and *nothing unproven passes the
gate*). The skill itself lives at [`skills/kerby/`](skills/kerby/SKILL.md); the rules
it loads live in [`skills/kerby/rulebooks/code/BOOTSTRAP.md`](skills/kerby/rulebooks/code/BOOTSTRAP.md).

This file is the repo-root context doc. Its main job is to hold the **harness-engineering
vocabulary** that `SKILL.md` references — the named primitives behind how `kerby` is
built. `kerby` is the canonical, working implementation of these primitives; when the
vocabulary below cites one abstractly, the concrete machinery is somewhere under
`skills/kerby/resources/`.

## Harness vocabulary

Building a rule-corpus like `kerby` is **harness engineering** — designing everything
*around* an agent that determines whether it succeeds: context, scaffolding, feedback,
state, evaluation. Naming the primitives lets edits be deliberate instead of accidental.

| Primitive | What it means | Concrete artifact in `kerby` |
|---|---|---|
| **Context engineering** | Organize information so the agent can reason over it — repo-local, versioned, not in chat threads. | `CONTEXT.md` (project glossary) + `BOOTSTRAP.md` (operating rules) + vendor agent-context files kept in sync — see `rulebooks/code/references/multi-tool.md`. |
| **Progressive disclosure** | Load detail on demand instead of front-loading everything. | `BOOTSTRAP.md` is the index; `rulebooks/code/references/*.md` carry the long-tail, loaded only when cited. |
| **Observable feedback loops** | Prefer machine-checkable signal over aspirational prose. | `rulebooks/base/hooks/pre-commit-check.sh`, `protect-env.sh`, `warn-env-read.sh`, `protect-git.sh` + gates in `references/quality-gates.md` and `references/validation.md`. |
| **State preservation** | Carry useful context across session boundaries. | `.kerby/memory.log` (append-only history) + `.kerby/STATUS.md` (current state) + `.kerby/knowledge/` (curated wiki) + `.kerby/BLOCKERS.md`, bootstrapped by `session-start-context.sh` + `knowledge-bootstrap.sh`. |
| **Eval discipline** | Decide what "working" means before shipping. | `references/quality-gates.md` + the verification-before-completion pattern; the pre-commit hook enforces gates mechanically rather than relying on agent memory. |

**How to use this vocabulary.** When you propose a new rule, ask: *which primitive is
this serving?* If you can't answer, the change is probably speculative. When you debug a
rule that "just isn't working," ask: *is the environment underspecified (context,
scaffolding, feedback) or is the prompt wrong?* Most agent failures are environment
failures wearing a prompt-failure mask.

### Control loop (loop engineering)

Prompt engineering optimizes a single forward pass. **Loop engineering** optimizes the
trajectory across many passes: the agent acts, observes a result (test output, build
error, screenshot), and that observation re-enters context and shapes the next action.
It is the runtime-control-flow half of harness engineering. `kerby` implements the loop
primitives; this table is the map — each row points to where the primitive is enforced.

| Primitive | One-line meaning | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Inner / outer check split | cheap check while coding, full gate at the boundary | `rulebooks/code/workflows/feature.md` (iteration-check tiers vs commit check) |
| Termination condition | what must be true to exit the loop | `rulebooks/code/references/validation.md` (Iron Law: no claim without fresh evidence) |
| Retry budget / circuit breaker | bounded retries per failure type, then escalate | `rulebooks/code/references/error-handling.md` (build 5 / test 3 / lint 5 → BLOCKED) |
| Bounded search | cap the hypothesis count so the loop can't flail | `rulebooks/code/references/debugging.md` (max 3 hypotheses) |
| State across iterations | what carries forward so the loop has no amnesia | `.kerby/memory.log`, `.kerby/STATUS.md`, checkpoint-before-context-fills |
| Iteration cost is the speed limit | a faster loop buys more hypotheses | `rulebooks/code/references/debugging.md` (assess the feedback loop first) |
| Parallel loops (fan-out) | independent iterations run concurrently | `rulebooks/code/references/sub-agent-delegation.md` (vertical slices, blind lenses) |

These are the runtime expression of the harness primitives above: *State across
iterations* is *State preservation* applied mid-task; the two check rows are *Observable
feedback loops* applied per-iteration. The rest (termination, retry budget, bounded
search, fan-out) are loop-specific.

**Bounded by design.** kerby's termination condition is deliberately *bounded*: the
loop exits on fresh verification evidence (the Iron Law) **or** on an exhausted
retry budget that escalates to a human (`BLOCKED`). It does **not** iterate
unboundedly toward "perfect." That bound is a choice, not an omission — *never leave
the repo broken* outranks autonomous self-correction, so a stuck loop hands off
rather than flails. This is the intended departure from naive "verify-until-done"
framings: a self-verification loop with no circuit breaker burns its budget
re-deriving the same wrong fix. The verification gate also leans behavioral by
design — the methodology travels across toolchains where a hardcoded check would not
(`skills/kerby/CLAUDE.md` § Authoring style). The one mechanical floor under it is
`rulebooks/base/hooks/pre-commit-check.sh`: the non-disablable secret scan, plus a soft
hollow-test heuristic that statically flags the green-but-empty fakes
(`rulebooks/code/references/validation.md` § What Counts as Evidence).

## Editing the rules

The skill-internal authoring guide lives at
[`skills/kerby/CLAUDE.md`](skills/kerby/CLAUDE.md) — read it before changing rule text
(every rule carries a recurring input-token cost; each should trace to a real past
failure). Run `python3 scripts/check-skill-compat.py` after any frontmatter or
version-bearing change, and `bash scripts/check-plan-gate-parity.sh` after any
change to the plan_threshold default or the grade-≥7 approval point (it fails if
those constants drift across the files that restate them — BOOTSTRAP, the
workflows, working-patterns, the schema, the template; the checked set is listed
in the script). If you add a new restatement, add the file to that set.

The product voice — how kerby *talks* in the README, verdict output, and CHANGELOG — is
specified in [`VOICE.md`](VOICE.md). Read it before editing any persona-bearing copy; the
rules and command references stay literal regardless (see its Zoning table).

## PR Workflow

Follows the **global PR workflow** in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (local `/codex:review`
loop-to-clean → squash-merge → merge on a local-clean review; GitHub `@codex review` poll
as the no-local-Codex fallback). No repo-specific tiers — the same Codex reviews locally,
so a second GitHub pass would only re-review identical bytes.

One repo-specific note: merging via this workflow **overrides kerby's own "leave for human
review" guardrail** for this repo — the owner has opted in.
