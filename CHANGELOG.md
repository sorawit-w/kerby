[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versioning is semver.

## [4.21.1] — 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **`prepare` now degrades cleanly on a repo with no git history.** `adopt-existing.md`
  issued the `git log` decision-scan and `git branch --show-current` as unconditional
  steps with no fallback, leaving the no-git case undefined — an agent could stall or
  `git init` unprompted (a repo-state change the ring-fence forbids). It now populates the
  code-derived artifacts only, skips the git-history knowledge scan, records the branch as
  `n/a (no git)`, and never `git init`s — mirroring `audit`'s existing no-git stance.
  Surfaced by a `skill-evaluator` absent-state audit.

## [4.21.0] — 2026-06-17

First release under the **`cerby`** name. The skill was extracted from
[`sorawit-w/agent-skills`](https://github.com/sorawit-w/agent-skills) — where it shipped
as `coding-rules` through v4.21.0 — into this standalone repo, with full commit history
preserved (`git log`). The version number is continuous with the `coding-rules` line; the
rename is the only change in this release.

### Changed
- **Renamed `coding-rules` → `cerby`** everywhere: skill `name`, trigger phrases, the
  `/cerby` invocation, the `CERBY_DIR` env var, hook-path signatures, glob discovery, and
  all prose. `coding-rules` is no longer recognized — invoke `cerby` (or `/cerby`).
- **Standalone packaging.** Own plugin manifests (Claude Code, Codex, Cowork), own
  `check-skill-compat.py`, vendored harness-engineering vocabulary in the repo-root
  `CLAUDE.md`. Sibling skills it used to be bundled with (`sub-agent-coordinator`,
  `team-composer`, `i18n`, `tech-stack-recommendations`, `brand-workshop`) are now
  optional external pointers to `sorawit-w/agent-skills` with graceful fallback.

### Notes
- Prior per-version history (v4.0–v4.21.0 under the `coding-rules` name) lives in the
  preserved git history and in the `sorawit-w/agent-skills` CHANGELOG.
- **Breaking:** anyone invoking `/coding-rules` must switch to `/cerby`. There is no
  back-compat alias by design — `cerby` is a clean-identity repo.
