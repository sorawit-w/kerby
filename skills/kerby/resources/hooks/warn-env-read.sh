# Hook: Soft-warn when the agent READS a .env file (security awareness)
# Type: PreToolUse on Read matching .env
# Name: warn-env-read
# Exit 0 always (never blocks). On a .env match it emits a PreToolUse advisory as
# JSON on STDOUT (hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext) — the documented channel
# the agent reads on exit 0. Plain stderr on exit 0 is NOT surfaced to the model
# for PreToolUse, so this hook does not use stderr.
#
# This is the soft, behavioral counterpart to protect-env.sh (which HARD-blocks
# .env *edits*). Reading .env is legitimate (the agent often needs the var names
# to wire things up) — so this never blocks. It only reminds the agent not to
# print secret VALUES into the conversation.
#
# COVERAGE GAP (documented, not a bug): the Claude Code matcher fires on the
# `Read` tool only. An agent reading a .env via Bash (`cat .env`, `grep KEY .env`)
# is invisible to this hook. See references/threat-model.md — this rule is
# [enforced-partial]: Read tool only, not shell.
#
# Disable with: CODING_RULES_HOOK_DISABLED=warn-env-read

# Respect the disable list (non-security soft hook).
