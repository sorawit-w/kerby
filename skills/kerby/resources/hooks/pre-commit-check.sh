# Hook: Soft-warn if lint/test haven't been run before committing
# Type: PreToolUse on Bash matching git commit
# Name: pre-commit-check
# Exit 0 = allow action. The soft reminder is injected as JSON on STDOUT
# (hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext) — plain stdout on exit 0 is NOT surfaced
# to the agent for PreToolUse. The hard-block path uses exit 2 + stderr (which IS
# shown on the blocking path).
#
# This does NOT hard-block commits. It checks if lint/test commands
# were run recently in this session and reminds the agent if not.
# This avoids blocking on pre-existing lint errors from other developers.
#
# Disable the soft reminder with: CODING_RULES_HOOK_DISABLED=pre-commit-check
# The secret scan below cannot be disabled via env var — it is a
# security guardrail. To bypass, remove the hook from settings.json.

# Secret scan on staged files.
# NOTE: This block is intentionally not gated by CODING_RULES_HOOK_DISABLED.
# Secret scanning is a hard security rule; disabling it requires editing
# settings.json, not setting an env var.
#
# Prefer gitleaks if present — broader coverage than the built-in regex, and it
# respects a repo-local .gitleaks.toml allowlist for example/test keys. Fall back
# to the narrow regex when gitleaks is absent OR errors. Critically, distinguish a
# gitleaks FINDING (exit 1 -> hard-block) from a TOOL ERROR (exit >=2 / 127 ->
# fall through to regex). A naive "nonzero -> block" would let a gitleaks config
# crash phantom-block every commit, and the block is non-disablable.
# (trufflehog is a viable alternative scanner; not wired here to keep one external
# integration and one test surface.)
# Pick a scanner by BINARY presence, not vendor (capability-gated). Prefer
# betterleaks (gitleaks' feature-frozen successor, same author) when installed,
# else gitleaks, else the built-in regex floor below.

REMINDER (kerby): Before committing, ensure you have:
1. Run the project's lint command on your changed files
2. Run the project's test suite
3. Verified the build passes
If any of these are failing due to YOUR changes, fix them before committing.
Pre-existing failures from other code are acceptable — do not block on them.
