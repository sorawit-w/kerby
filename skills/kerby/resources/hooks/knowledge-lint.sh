# Hook: Lint .kerby/knowledge/ for mechanical integrity drift
# Type: manual + optional git post-commit
# Name: knowledge-lint
#
# Two zero-dependency correctness checks over .kerby/knowledge/ entries:
#   1. BROKEN-LINK     — a `related:` frontmatter target that names a file
#                        which does not exist in .kerby/knowledge/.
#   2. SUPERSEDE-NO-POINTER — an entry with a `## Superseded` section whose
#                        body names no replacement entry (no `.md` token).
#
# These are pure mechanical checks — no LLM, no API key. They are the
# always-on integrity floor. The heavier semantic lint (contradiction,
# orphan, stale) is OpenKB's job; see references/external-resources.md.
# Kept separate from knowledge-reindex.sh on purpose — different failure
# mode (integrity vs indexing). Do not fold the two together.
#
# Behavior:
# - If agent-context.yaml has `knowledge.enabled: false`, exits silently.
# - If `.kerby/knowledge/` is missing, prints nothing and exits 0.
# - Default (advisory): prints findings to stdout, always exits 0.
# - `--strict`: exits 1 if any finding, else 0.
#
# Disable with: CODING_RULES_HOOK_DISABLED=knowledge-lint
# See references/hooks.md for the env-var convention.
