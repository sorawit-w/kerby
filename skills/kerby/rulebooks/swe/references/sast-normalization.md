# SARIF Normalization (`kerby code audit --sast`)

semgrep output is **not byte-stable by default** — it carries absolute paths, scan
timestamps, a tool-version stamp, and an unstable result order. Pinning the engine +
ruleset fixes *what* is found, not *how it serializes*. This pass turns a pinned
scan's SARIF into a byte-identical artifact, so two `kerby code audit --sast` runs on the
same tree produce the same report. Run it on the raw SARIF **before** mapping to
finding rows (`audit.md` § 6).

## Steps (in order)

1. **Relativize paths.** Rewrite every
   `runs[].results[].locations[].physicalLocation.artifactLocation.uri` to
   repo-root-relative; strip the scan host's working-dir prefix. Absolute paths are
   the most common source of cross-machine drift.
2. **Strip volatile fields.** Remove `runs[].tool.driver.version`,
   `runs[].invocation` (start/end times, durations, exit codes),
   `runs[].originalUriBaseIds`, and any `properties` carrying scan time / host /
   duration. They change every run and carry no finding signal.
3. **Canonical finding identity.** For each result compute a stable key
   `(ruleId, relPath, startLine, startColumn, endLine, endColumn, sha256(message))`.
   Include the **full region** (start *and* end line/column), not just `startLine`:
   two matches of the same rule on one line with the same message but different
   columns would otherwise collide on the key, and the tie would fall back to
   semgrep's explicitly-unstable result order — reintroducing the drift this pass
   exists to remove. Normalize the message before hashing: trim, collapse internal
   whitespace to single spaces, strip any embedded absolute path. Hashing the
   *normalized* message keeps two genuinely-distinct co-located findings distinct —
   don't sort on raw message text, where whitespace alone would reorder them.
4. **Stable total-order sort.** Sort all results by the full tuple
   `(ruleId, relPath, startLine, startColumn, endLine, endColumn, message-hash)`. The
   order must be **total** — no ties left to filesystem or scan order — the same
   discipline `audit.md` § 7 applies to report rows. (If two results are still equal
   on every component they are byte-identical, so their relative order can't change
   the serialized output.)
5. **Canonical serialization.** Emit with sorted JSON object keys, fixed separators,
   LF newlines, no trailing whitespace, fixed numeric formatting. Two logically
   identical result sets must serialize to identical bytes.
6. **Map to finding rows.** Each normalized result → a `table.findings` `<tr>`
   (`audit.md` § 6), confidence `observed` (= *tool-reported, not confirmed*). Carry
   `ruleId` into the Rule cell's `<span class="src">`. A result with no OWASP/CWE tag
   (`properties.tags` / `external/cwe/*` absent) is bucketed under the Rule name
   **`uncategorized`** — never dropped (a dropped finding is the silent-cap failure
   the banner exists to prevent). Paths and code excerpts are untrusted
   (`audit.md` § 1 / § 8) — escaped + `<code>`-wrapped at interpolation.

## Determinism gate (Phase-2)

Flipping `--sast` from opt-in to **default-on** is gated on this — and only this —
passing. It is a **manual regression checklist, not a runner**: kerby ships
fixtures/specs, not harnesses (same stance as `.eval/triggers/kerby.json`; see
`skills/kerby/CLAUDE.md`). No gate auto-discovers or runs it.

Procedure: run the full `--sast` pipeline (provision-from-pins → offline scan → this
normalization → render) **twice across two machines and two days**, then assert
`sha256` equality on (a) the normalized SARIF and (b) the rendered `table.findings`
block. All four runs must match. Only then is the default-on change authorized. Any
mismatch names a volatile field this pass missed — fix it here first.
