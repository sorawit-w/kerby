# Hooks — coding enforcers

The coding rulebook's tool-boundary enforcers. Hook mechanics — registration,
runtime toggles, strictness levels, the SessionStart state trio — live in the
engine doc: `<install-root>/resources/references/hooks.md`.

### PreToolUse → .env File Protection

**Script:** `hooks/protect-env.sh`
**Strictness:** Hard-block (exit 2)
**Matcher:** `Edit|Write` targeting `.env` files

Prevents the agent from editing `.env` files directly. This is a security guardrail — secrets should never be modified by an agent. If the agent needs environment variables set, it should document them in `DEVELOPER_TODO.md` instead.

### PreToolUse → .env Read Warning

**Script:** `hooks/warn-env-read.sh`
**Strictness:** Soft-warn (exit 0; injects the reminder via stdout JSON `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`) — disablable
**Matcher:** `Read` targeting `.env` files

The behavioral counterpart to `protect-env`. Reading a `.env` is legitimate (the agent often needs the variable *names* to wire things up), so this never blocks — it only reminds the agent not to print secret *values* into the conversation. Disablable via `CODING_RULES_HOOK_DISABLED=warn-env-read`.

**Coverage gap (by design, not a bug):** the Claude Code matcher fires on the `Read` tool only. An agent reading a `.env` via Bash (`cat .env`, `grep KEY .env`) is invisible to this hook — that path stays a [behavioral] rule (`guardrails.md`: "never print a live secret"). See `references/threat-model.md` for why the in-context boundary can't be hook-enforced. Self-tested by `hooks/warn-env-read.test.sh`.

### PreToolUse → High-Stakes Path Routing

**Script:** `hooks/route-high-stakes.sh`
**Strictness:** Soft-warn (exit 0; injects a reminder via stdout JSON `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`) — disablable
**Matcher:** `Edit|Write` targeting BOOTSTRAP §3 high-stakes paths

Makes BOOTSTRAP §3's high-stakes path override **[enforced-partial]** instead of pure [behavioral]. When the agent edits a path matching §3's globs (auth, schema migrations, payments/billing, infrastructure, CI/CD), it emits a one-line reminder that the change requires `workflows/feature.md` / `bugfix.md` + the §4 Plan Gate — **not** `quick-task.md`, even for a one-liner. It never blocks: routing is a *decision*, not a destructive-action veto. Disablable via `CODING_RULES_HOOK_DISABLED=route-high-stakes`.

**Single source of truth:** the matched globs are embedded in the script byte-identical to BOOTSTRAP §3, and `hooks/route-high-stakes.test.sh` asserts parity — it fails if §3 gains a glob the hook doesn't carry, so the two can't silently drift.

**Coverage gap (by design, not a bug):** §3's sixth category — *production-traffic-shaping values* (retry/timeout/rate-limit constants, feature-flag defaults, secrets-loading code) — is prose with no glob and cannot be path-matched; it stays [behavioral]. That named gap is what makes this rule [enforced-partial] rather than [enforced]. Matching is case-insensitive so filename patterns catch `Login.tsx` / `UserToken.ts`. **Delivery mechanism:** the reminder is emitted as stdout JSON (`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`), *not* stderr — on exit 0 a PreToolUse hook's stderr is not surfaced to the agent, only its JSON-on-stdout is. It carries no `permissionDecision`, so the edit proceeds through normal permissions (it reminds, never auto-approves). Self-tested by `hooks/route-high-stakes.test.sh`. *(Pattern absorbed concept-only from `paulDuvall/ai-development-patterns` (MIT) — Progressive Disclosure; see `NOTICE`.)*

### PreToolUse → git commit (two independent hooks)

Two hooks register on `Bash` running `git commit`, and run independently — a
hard floor from `base`, and swe's own soft advisory. Before v9.3 both lived in one
bundled script; they are now cleanly separated.

**a. Secret scan — the base floor (hard-block).**
**Script:** `<install-root>/rulebooks/base/hooks/pre-commit-check.sh` (base's, not swe's)
**Strictness:** Hard-block on secrets (exit 2 + stderr); silent exit 0 otherwise
Capability-gated on the binary: prefers `betterleaks`, then `gitleaks`, if either is on `PATH` (broader coverage, respects the scanner's repo-local allowlist), scanning the staged *added* lines via the version-stable `stdin` mode (`git diff --cached -U0 | <scanner> stdin --exit-code 7`). Falls back to a built-in regex (`sk_live_`, `AKIA`, private keys, hardcoded passwords) when no scanner is present or it errors. A *finding* (distinct exit code 7) blocks the commit; a *tool error* (any other nonzero — their default exit 1 means "leaks OR error") falls through to the regex rather than phantom-blocking. **Cannot be disabled via env var.** It is `base`'s floor, registered for every selection (not swe-specific). Self-tested by base's `hooks/pre-commit-check.test.sh`. *(betterleaks is the gitleaks author's feature-frozen-gitleaks successor; the `stdin` invocation is what survives gitleaks' 8.19 reorg that deprecated `protect`.)*

**b. Hollow-test + quality-gate reminder — swe's soft check.**
**Script:** `hooks/hollow-test-check.sh`
**Strictness:** Soft-warn only (always exit 0; advisory via stdout JSON `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`)
Two soft advisories, never blocking:
- **Hollow-test heuristic** — statically counts focused/disabled markers (`.only`/`.skip`/`fit`/`xit`) and always-true assertions in the *added* lines of staged test/spec files, and notes them (counts only, never the raw lines). Surfaces the "green run that proves nothing" fakes `validation.md` names.
- **Quality gate reminder** — reminds the agent to run lint/test/build on changed files. Because a PreToolUse `additionalContext` surfaces *with* the tool result (next turn), it arrives as the commit completes — a **post-commit safety net** (run the gates, amend if your changes broke them), not a pre-commit veto. Turning it into a checkpoint would mean `permissionDecision: ask`/`deny` — a deliberate commit-discipline change, intentionally not made.

Disable both with `CODING_RULES_HOOK_DISABLED=hollow-test-check` (the legacy `pre-commit-check` token is also honored). Self-tested by `hooks/hollow-test-check.test.sh`.

### No Stop hook — quality gates are not verified mechanically

**Nothing checks that a gate ran.** This rulebook ships no `Stop` hook, and none is
registered by `kerby install` — grep the manifests: no check declares `event = "Stop"`.
Earlier revisions of this file described a prompt hook that "checks whether quality gates
were run during the turn"; that hook never existed, and the claim is removed rather than
softened.

The only mechanical signal near the commit boundary is the soft advisory in (b) above,
which arrives *after* the commit and is disablable. Running the gate at the tier the
staged diff selects (`references/quality-gates.md` § At Commit Time) is **behavioral** —
held by the rules and by review, not by a hook.
