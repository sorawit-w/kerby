# Quick Task Workflow

For simple tasks — single-file edits, config changes, documentation updates, or fixes with obvious root cause (complexity below `plan_threshold` — default 4, i.e. the low band).

**Branching:** use a normal `git checkout -b` — the in-place branch default from `BOOTSTRAP.md` § Branching. (If the task turns out to be more complex than expected, escalate to the task-type workflow — `bugfix.md` for a bug fix, else `feature.md` — and **continue on the same in-place branch**; escalating workflows never changes the branching default, and a worktree is created only if a § Branching escalation trigger applies.)

## Fit Check (before you start)

The quick-task path is appropriate only when ALL of these hold. If even one fails, switch to the task-type workflow (`bugfix.md` for a bug fix, else `workflows/feature.md`) and start from its step 2 — no exceptions.

- **No new files** — you're editing existing files only, not adding modules
- **No test logic changes** — tests may *run* during checks, but you're not modifying assertions, test scaffolding, or fixtures
- **No schema, contract, or public-type changes** — no DB migrations, no exported type/interface shape changes, no public API edits
- **No high-stakes paths** — auth, payments, migrations, infra, CI/CD, production-traffic-shaping constants (see BOOTSTRAP.md §3 "High-stakes path override")
- **Diff stays ≤ ~50 LOC** — rough budget; if you're approaching it, the change isn't a quick task
- **Change is strings, copy, comments, config values, data, or formatting** — not new logic, not refactoring, not behavior change

**Why this is hard-floored, not advisory:** quick-task skips overhead because the risk surface is bounded. Violating any criterion means the risk surface is no longer bounded — at that point the savings are illusory and the discipline of the full task-type workflow (`feature.md` / `bugfix.md`) is the cheaper path overall.

**Grade ceiling vs. risk guard — two independent axes.** The complexity ceiling tracks `plan_threshold` (raising the knob never lowers the bar here); the criteria above are independent risk guards. A change that introduces logic, refactors, exceeds the LOC budget, or touches schema/contracts escalates to the task-type workflow (`bugfix.md` / `feature.md`) *even when its grade is below the threshold*. Both the grade ceiling and the fit check must hold.

**State your fit check before starting**, in 2–4 lines:

```
Quick-task fit:
- Files: <list>
- Estimated LOC: <number>
- Type of change: <strings / config / comments / docs / formatting>
- No new files / tests / schema / contracts / high-stakes paths: confirmed
```

If you can't state it cleanly, the task doesn't fit. Switch workflows.

## Steps

1. **Read** — project conventions and recent history (you already did this in BOOTSTRAP.md step 2)
2. **Do** — implement the change, match existing patterns
3. **Scope-check, then quality-check** — first verify the actual diff stayed within fit criteria; then run the appropriate quality gate:

   **3a. Scope-check (diff vs. declared fit):**
   ```bash
   git diff --stat
   ```
   Compare actual diff to your declared fit check. If ANY of these now hold, STOP and escalate to the task-type workflow (`bugfix.md` for a bug fix, else `workflows/feature.md`):
   - Diff exceeds ~50 LOC across the change
   - Diff introduces a new file you didn't declare
   - Diff touches a test file, schema/migration file, contract/type file, or a high-stakes path (per BOOTSTRAP.md §3)
   - You found yourself changing behavior or logic mid-implementation, not just strings/config

   Escalation is not a setback — it's the system working. Do NOT commit a Tier-mismatched diff to escape the workflow change.

   **3b. Quality-check (only if 3a passed):** choose gate tier based on what you changed (see `references/quality-gates.md`):
   - Config, docs, comments, formatting → `{lint_command}` only
   - Logic changes → `{lint_command}` + related tests
   - Then **always run full gates before committing:**
     ```bash
     {build_command} && {lint_command} && {test_command}
     ```
4. **Commit:**
   ```bash
   git add <specific-files>
   git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>"
   ```
5. **Log** — append to `.kerby/memory.log`
6. **Tell the developer how to verify** — emit the **How to Verify** block per `BOOTSTRAP.md` § 4 (Manual Verification Instructions).

## If It's Not Simple

If the task turns out to be more complex than expected (touching multiple files, unexpected failures, unclear requirements), switch to the full workflow for the task type — **`bugfix.md` for a bug fix** (it keeps the reproduce → diagnose → failing-test path), otherwise **`feature.md`**:

Read that workflow and start from its step 2 (Clarify in `feature.md`, Reproduce in `bugfix.md`).
