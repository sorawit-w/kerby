# Hook: Advise a full-workflow self-route when the agent EDITS a high-stakes path.
# Type: PreToolUse on Edit|Write matching BOOTSTRAP §3 high-stakes globs.
# Name: route-high-stakes
# Exit 0 always (never blocks). On a high-stakes match it emits a PreToolUse
# advisory as JSON on STDOUT (hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext) — the
# documented channel the agent reads on exit 0. Plain stderr on exit 0 is NOT
# surfaced to the model for PreToolUse, so this hook does not use stderr.
#
# This is the soft, behavioral counterpart that makes BOOTSTRAP §3's high-stakes
# path override [enforced-partial] instead of pure [behavioral]: an agent editing
# a one-line change inside `**/auth/**` (etc.) gets a reminder that this path
# requires feature.md / bugfix.md + the §4 Plan Gate, NOT quick-task. It never
# blocks — routing is a decision, not a destructive-action veto.
#
# GLOB SOURCE — canonical list is BOOTSTRAP §3 (rulebooks/code/BOOTSTRAP.md, the
# "High-stakes path override" bullets). The GLOBS array below embeds those exact
# strings; route-high-stakes.test.sh asserts parity against §3 and FAILS if §3
# gains a glob this array doesn't carry. Keep the strings byte-identical to §3.
#
# COVERAGE GAP (documented, not a bug): §3's sixth category —
# production-traffic-shaping values (retry/timeout/rate-limit constants,
# feature-flag defaults, secrets-loading code) — is prose with no glob and CANNOT
# be path-matched. It stays [behavioral]. That named gap is what makes this rule
# [enforced-partial] rather than [enforced].
#
# Pattern absorbed (concept only, reimplemented) from
# paulDuvall/ai-development-patterns (MIT) — Progressive Disclosure. See NOTICE.

# Disable with: CODING_RULES_HOOK_DISABLED=route-high-stakes

# Respect the disable list (non-security soft hook).
