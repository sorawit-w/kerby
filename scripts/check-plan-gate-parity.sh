# Parity: the Plan Gate constants must agree across EVERY file that restates them.
#
# Two constants are duplicated across shipped guidance (each file must stand
# alone): the plan_threshold DEFAULT (4) and the fixed APPROVAL point (grade >= 7).
# Nothing stops them drifting when one file is edited and the rest aren't — this
# does. CLAUDE.md tells authors to rely on this guard after changing either
# constant, so the checked set must include ALL restatements, not just two files.
# When a new restatement ships, add the file to the set below (or drop its literal).
#
# Mirrors the bidirectional glob-parity guard in hooks/route-high-stakes.test.sh:
# same teeth-bearing shape, so shipped guidance can't silently disagree.
#
# Run: bash scripts/check-plan-gate-parity.sh
# Exit 0 = constants agree everywhere and the cap invariant holds; non-zero =
# cross-file drift, within-file drift, a missing constant, or default > approval.
